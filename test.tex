\maketitle
This article demonstrates a basic set of LaTeX formatting commands.
Compare the typeset output side-by-side with the input document.


Here is a very simple table showing data lined up in columns.
Notice that I include the table in a ``center'' environment to display
it properly.
The title is created simply as another paragraph in the center environment,
rather than as part of the table itself.
\begin{center}
Numbers of Computers on Earth Sciences Network, By Type.

\begin{tabular}{lr}
Macintosh&175\\
DOS/Windows PC&60\\
Unix Workstation or server&110\\
\end{tabular}
